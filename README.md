Citi bike data from the calendar year 2018 was aggregrated by month and Start station.


Phenomena 1
Which start stations had the highest ride duration.
Visualizations
1.  The start stations with the highest average trip duration in descending order will be visualized by horizontal bar graph.
2.  Line chart showing the changes in average ride duration over the months of the calendar year.
3.  Static map of the NYC bubble plot of the stations with highest ride duration. 

Phenomena 2
Which start stations had the highest number of rides.
Visualizations
1.  The start stations with the highest number of rides originating from it in descending order was visualized by horizontal bar graph.
2.  Change of the top 10 stations with highest number of ride frequency from January to July.
3.  Static map of the NYC bubble plot of the stations with highest number of rides originating from it. 
3.  Dynamic map of the NYC bubble plot of the stations with highest number of rides originating from it by month.  Driven by slide filter.

Unexpected phenomena:
1.  There were 10 start stations where the average duration of the ride for 2018 exceed 133 minutes or 2.25 hours. The average for one station, Sullivan Pl & Bedford Ave exceeding 362 minutes or 6 hours!  The average durations for all stations in 2018 was 16 minutes.
2.  In 2018, of the 17,545,839 Citibike rides in NYC, 20 stations accounted for 5% of the total.
3. As expected, both the number and duration of CitiBike trips would increase with the warmer months.  That is mostly the case however, the total number of rides drops off dramatically from July to August.  From a high of 1.8 mil to 955k - almost by half.  For comparison, the total rides in February was 1 mil.  The totals for September and the postceding months taper down consistent to the August value.
